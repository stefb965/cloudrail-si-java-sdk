With CloudRail, you can easily integrate external APIs into your application. 
CloudRail is an abstracted interface that takes several services and then gives a developer-friendly API that uses common functions between all providers. 
This means that, for example, upload() works in exactly the same way for Dropbox as it does for Google Drive, OneDrive, and other Cloud Storage Services, and getEmail() works similarly the same way across all social networks.

## Current Interfaces:
Interface | Included Services 
--- | --- 
Cloud Storage | Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, Box, Egnyte
Business Cloud Storage | AmazonS3, Microsoft Azure, Rackspace, Backblaze
Social Profiles | Facebook, GitHub, Google+, LinkedIn, Slack, Twitter, Windows Live, Yahoo, Instagram
Social Interaction | Facebook, Twitter
Payment | PayPal, Stripe
Email | Maljet, Sendgrid
SMS | Twilio, Nexmo
Point of Interest | Google Places, Foursquare, Yelp

## Advantages of Using CloudRail

* Consistent Interfaces: As functions work the same across all services, you can perform tasks between services simply.

* Easy Authentication: CloudRail includes easy ways to authenticate, to remove one of the biggest hassles of coding for external APIs.

* Switch services instantly: One line of code is needed to set up the service you are using. Changing which service is as simple as changing the name to the one you wish to use.

* Simple Documentation: There is no searching around Stack Overflow for the answer. The CloudRail documentation at https://documentation.cloudrail.com/java/java/Home is regularly updated, clean, and simple to use.

* No Maintenance Times: The CloudRail Libraries are updated when a provider changes their API.

* Direct Data: Everything happens directly in the Library. No data ever passes a CloudRail server.
